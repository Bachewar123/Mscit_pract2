A)Code for conditional probability:

pofB=float(input("Enter number of C programmers in percentage ")) 
pofAandB=float(input("Enter number of C and Java programmers in percentage ")) 
pofB=pofB/100
pofAandB=pofAandB/100
print("Event A that student is Java Progammer=?") 
print("Event B that student is C Progammer=",pofB)
print("Event A and B that is student knowing both C and Java is =",pofAandB) 
print("Lets Calculate P(A|B)= P(A and B) / P(B)")
pAgivenB=pofAandB / pofB 
print("P(A|B)=",pAgivenB)
print("There are ",pAgivenB *100," % chances that the student that knows C also knowsJava")


B)Code for Joint Probability:

cardnumber=input("Enter number of Card") 
cardcolor=input("Enter color of Card") 
pofA=4/52
pofB=26/52
print("p(A)=>Probablility of drawing card 
with number 
",cardnumber,"=",round(pofA,2))
print("p(B)=>Probablility of drawing card with color ",cardcolor," =",round(pofB,2)) 
print("Joint Probablity of A and B=P(A) * P(B)")
pAandB=round(pofA pofB,2) 
print("P(A and B)=",pAandB)
print("There are ",pAandB *100," % chances that of getting ",cardcolor, “ card with number”, cardnumber)
